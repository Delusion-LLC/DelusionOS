what Idle is - Disabling idle states forces C-State 0, which can be seen in HWiNFO, and is in Microsoft's recommendations for configuring devices for real-time performance (1). Forcing C-State 0 mitigates the undesirable delay to execute new instructions on a CPU that has entered a deeper power-saving state at the expense of higher temperatures and power consumption. Therefore, I would recommend keeping idle states enabled for the majority of readers as other problems can occur due to these side effects (e.g. throttling, power issues).
